### About the Project üìö

This project is a visualization of three fundamental algorithms in computer science: **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, and **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**. These algorithms are commonly used for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. 

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** üåê: Explores all nodes at the current depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It is useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** üîç: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It is often used for solving puzzles or exploring all possible paths.
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)** ‚öñÔ∏è: A variant of Dijkstra's algorithm that finds the lowest-cost path in weighted graphs. It prioritizes nodes with the lowest cumulative cost.

The visualization is built using **Pygame Zero**, a beginner-friendly framework for creating games and graphical applications in Python. Pygame Zero simplifies the process of drawing graphics and handling user input, making it an excellent tool for visualizing algorithms in an interactive and engaging way.

By running this program, you can observe how each algorithm explores nodes, makes decisions, and ultimately finds a solution. This visualization helps in understanding the differences and use cases of BFS, DFS, and UCS in a more intuitive manner.

### Why Visualize Algorithms? ü§î
Visualizing algorithms like BFS, DFS, and UCS helps bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical understanding. By seeing how these algorithms work step-by-step, you can:
- **Gain a deeper understanding** of their mechanics.
- **Compare their performance** in different scenarios.
- **Appreciate their real-world applications**, such as pathfinding in maps, puzzle-solving, and network routing.
